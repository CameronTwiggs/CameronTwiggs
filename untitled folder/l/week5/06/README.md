This is a warmup exercise on Objects

OPEN UP THE SKELETON CODE IN UNSOLVED

* Make a dogs object with three keys (ie properties)...

  - First key called "raining" with a value of true

  - Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"

  - Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the value of the noise key if it is raining dogs (HINT - to reference the noice key you need to this.noise)

* Make a cats object with three keys...

  - First key called "raining" with a value of false

  - Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"

  - Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the value of the noise key if it is raining cats

* Make the dog bark

* Make the cat meow

* Finally: Create a function called "massHysteria" which takes in both the cats and the dogs object and prints "DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!" if both of the `raining` keys are equal to true.
