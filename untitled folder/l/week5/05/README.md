### Quick Demo
* MY RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR

* This app was built using technologies that you have not yet learned! So the idea here is not to focus on the bootstrap or jquery code used to render the web site, but rather the logic driving the workflow


* Demo highlights
- You'll see a click event is registered on a button (the button is stled by bootstrap. The event is registered through jquery)
- Math.random and Math.floor are used to generate a random number betwene 1 and 4
- Note the logic flow comparing your number (based on the button clicked) with the randowm number generated
