### Your Assignment
* Your client has asked you to build a weather app

You have a set of starter code in the unsolved folder which connects with a weather website.

Your mission is to run the app, analyze the api response, and figure out how to select an object from the ayyar for Moscow. 

Most developers invest considerable time upfront trying to understand the data they are working with before coding an application. Just like the movie example, you'll need to figure out how response object is organized, and how to select the correct object 

 - Once you select the object, dump the JSON object on the webpage
 - console.log the temperature, city and other properties of your choosing from the weather object

Follow the workflow in the movie app if you need a point of reference
