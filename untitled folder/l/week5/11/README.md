### Demo
* Fetching Data and Handling Objects

* Objects, arrays and functions are some of the most powerful constucts in application programming. In this demonstration, we show

- a common pattern for fetching an array of objects. Note the .then() chain of commands, showing that data is being processed (transformed) and passed to the next block of activity in the sequence
- a common pattern for iterating through an array objects to process data
- rendering data to a webpage 

* API - 

In order to fetch some data to work with our application, we are going to use an api from the open movie database site
