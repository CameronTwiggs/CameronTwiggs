### BootStrap Buttons

This demo and class exercise illustrates the power of Bootstrap in creating beautifully styled html elements which are also mobile responsive!

* The button element in HTML is clickable
- it can be used in forms
- it can be used on any page to trigger a function

* Open the demo and review both files. One file creates a styled button without the benefit of bootstrap, and the other with bootstrap

## Your Assignment

- Take 3 minutes and review the bootstrap docs on how to create a button element. Add to the buttons in the mybutton.html file in the unsolved folder using a class of btn-warning
